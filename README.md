# web server thing

simple little web server i'm making in C++ with linux sys calls :)

## TODO:
- ~~make 404 a thing cause otherwise it crashes the server cause of favicon.ico~~ Fixed :)
- make / redirect to index.html *properly* (i think it should work properly now)
- add threading cause it would be cool (and i think is needed so images and other things the client needs to download while visiting a website will work)

:)
