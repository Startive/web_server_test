# web server thing

simple little web server i'm making in C++ with linux sys calls :)

## TODO:
- ~~make 404 a thing cause otherwise it crashes the server cause of favicon.ico~~ Fixed :)
- make / redirect to index.html *properly* (i think it should work properly now)
- add threading cause it would be cool and would help performance
- add some extra HTTP headers so images, js and other things that the html tries to grab works as intended

- add POST requests

:)
