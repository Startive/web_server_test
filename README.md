# web server thing

simple little web server i'm making in C++ with linux sys calls :)

## TODO:
- tokenize or enumerate the http headers because it's just better to do it that way rather than a bunch of checks in messy code
- fix server being easily able to be crashed by just spamming the url or requesting too many times
- add extra HTTP headers and parse the HTTP headers from the request better
- add POST requests, and make a little API with it :D
